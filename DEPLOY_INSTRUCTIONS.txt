DEPLOYING TURING MACHINE DEMO - 3 STEPS
==========================================

STEP 1: CREATE GITHUB REPO
---------------------------
I just opened https://github.com/new in your browser.

Fill in:
- Repository name: Turing-Machine-Demo
- Description: Interactive visualization of P ≠ NP proof via spectral gap separation
- Public: YES (check the box)
- DO NOT initialize with README (we already have one)

Click "Create repository"


STEP 2: PUSH CODE
-----------------
After creating the repo, run these commands in PowerShell:

cd H:\OneDrive\Documents\Turing-Machine-Demo
git remote add origin https://github.com/FractalDevTeam/Turing-Machine-Demo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


STEP 3: ENABLE GITHUB PAGES
----------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/FractalDevTeam/Turing-Machine-Demo/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Under "Branch", select "main" and folder "/ (root)"
4. Click Save


DONE! YOUR SITE WILL BE LIVE AT:
https://fractaldevteam.github.io/Turing-Machine-Demo/

Refresh after 30 seconds and you'll see your Turing machine!
